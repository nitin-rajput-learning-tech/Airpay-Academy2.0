# State Card — `local_airpay_programs`

**Component:** `local_airpay_programs`
**Version:** `2026052001` / `1.8.1`  (+P1 #45 Hindi top-up)
**Maturity:** `MATURITY_STABLE`
**Status:** Live on airpay.academy. Replaces BizLMS `local_program`.
**Last refreshed:** 2026-05-24 (P1 state-card pass)

---

## Mission

Multi-level certification programs — sequential tiers of courses
("Foundation" → "Practitioner" → "Expert"). Each level can contain
multiple required + optional courses; completing a level unlocks the
next.

Sibling to `local_airpay_learningpath` (which is a flat sequence);
programs add the level + tiered-certification layer.

## DB tables (4)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `local_airpay_programs` | Program definition (name, status, certification authority) |
| `local_airpay_programs_levels` | Levels within a program (ordered) |
| `local_airpay_programs_courses` | Courses assigned to a level (with required / optional flag) |
| `local_airpay_programs_users` | User enrolments in programs (current level + status) |

## Capabilities (6)

`local/airpay_programs:` `view`, `manage`, `create`, `update`, `delete`,
`enrol`.

## Feature flags

None registered.

## Tests

4 PHPUnit classes, 41 methods. `levels_test.php` is the deepest —
covers the level-unlock state machine.

## Open items

- [ ] Per-level capability gate (today: program-wide caps only)
- [ ] Cohort-scoped enrolment (today: tenant-scoped only)
- [ ] Program certificate template integration with `tool_certificate`
- [ ] Manager program-progress view (depends on `local_airpay_manager`
      reporting-line resolver)
- [ ] Mobile program-detail polish

## State card created — 2026-05-24

Initial state card. Plugin has been live for many phases; created now
as part of the P1 state-card pass.

## ADR-018 Wave 2 — open_path → tenant_identity seam (2026-05-30)

Direct `$USER->open_path` / entity `open_path` parsing in this plugin was migrated
onto the `local_sentientia_core\tenant_identity` seam (`root_for_user` /
`root_for_current_user` / `department_for_user` / `subdepartment_for_user` /
`path_root` / `path_for_user`). Behaviour-identical — the legacy BizLMS parse stays
the default-ON source behind `tenant_identity_legacy`. Shipped via the
feat/wave2-callers-* branches (merged to production 2026-05-30). DEPRECATION-SCHEDULE row 7.


## 2026-09-24 - White-label display name (W2-06)

`pluginname` no longer carries the Airpay brand: "Airpay X" became "Sentientia X", and in Hindi
"एयरपे" became "सेंटिएंटिया". Where one tree already had a Sentientia name it was reused, so both trees now
agree. Lang-string change only: no version bump is needed, and the deploy's cache purge picks it up.
Part of the 36-plugin rename that makes Site administration > Plugins show no customer brand on a
white-label product. `paygw_airpay` keeps "Airpay", correctly: it is named after the payment company.


## 2026-09-24 - DPDP erasure kept deleting certification records

**Defect.** `local_sentientia_privacy\privacy_manager::process_deletion()` (the DPDP
right-to-erasure flow) calls a Sentientia provider's `anonymise_data_for_user()` when it has
one and `delete_data_for_user()` otherwise. This provider had no anonymise hook, so every
approved erasure deleted the person's `local_sentientia_programs_users` rows: the
certification-program enrolment and COMPLETION record (status 2 + `timecompleted`). That flow
promises to keep completions, anonymised, against the user row it anonymises in place.

**Fix.** `privacy\provider::anonymise_data_for_user()` added. Table by table:
- `local_sentientia_programs_users`: kept unchanged, keyed to the anonymised user. Every column
  is record data (ids, status code, timestamps); no free text to blank. In-progress enrolments
  are kept too (`currentlevelid` is part of the record).
- `local_sentientia_programs`, `_levels`, `_courses`: no user column; nothing to do.

The method body is deliberately empty: its existence is what routes the DPDP flow away from
the delete. `delete_data_for_user()` is unchanged and stays core's full erasure.

**Test.** `tests/privacy_anonymise_test.php`: the rows (and their status, completion time,
level) survive `anonymise_data_for_user()`; `delete_data_for_user()` still erases them and only
them. Written, not yet run (shared test DB being rebuilt). No version bump (class change only).
Both trees.
